# In PowerShell/Terminal:
cd "c:\Users\User\Desktop\energy game"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Energy Game ready to deploy"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/energy-game.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Don't have GitHub?** Create free account at https://github.com/signup (1 minute)

### Step 2️⃣: Deploy to Vercel (3 minutes)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/signup
2. Sign up with GitHub (easiest)
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Select `energy-game` repository
5. Click **"Deploy"**
6. **Wait 2-3 minutes**

### Step 3️⃣: Share Your Game! 🎮

When deployment finishes, Vercel gives you a URL like:
